# Technical Keyboard

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

A four-row, shell-friendly keyboard layout for [AnySoftKeyboard](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard).  There are other SSH/shell keyboard layouts out there (like [Hackers' Keyboard](https://github.com/bisermilanov/hackerskeyboard) or [ssh_anysoftkeyboard](https://github.com/pi3ch/ssh_anysoftkeyboard)), but for various reasons I decided to write my own.

Many thanks to [Pedram Hayati](https://github.com/pi3ch/), whose [ssh_anysoftkeyboard](https://github.com/pi3ch/ssh_anysoftkeyboard) provided a starting point for this project.
